# Super-Mario-Bros-Clone
This is my first take on a clone of the classic Super Mario Bros game.
I will try to keep adding new features and optimizations when I have time.
Yes, I know my way of coding this game wasn't the most efficient, but
I was focused towards the completion of it instead of the quality. 
Currently, the game manages a 60fps lock and 200fps on a i5 2.9ghz CPU.
Pygame doesn't use any rendering backend (openGL,directX,vulcan etc) so,
gpu isn't used here. All the calculations are done by the cpu itself.

The game doesn't use too much memory. Currently, it only uses 37MB.
